### **The Repository**
This repository (challenge-05) contains HTML code, a CSS stylesheet, and a script.js sheet for Javascript code. This is a submission for University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

### **The Process**
Starter code was provided for this project. CSS was already complete. I added to the HTML utilizing Bootstrap and composed the Javascript.

### **Requirements Met**
* The current date is diplayed at the top of the scheduler.
* On scroll, you can see time blocks for standard business hours.
* Daily time blocks are color-coded to indicate past, present, or future.
* When the User clicks into a time block, an event (text) can be entered.
* Clicking on the Save Button saves the event (text) in Local Storage.
* When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.

### **Result**
The Work Day Scheduler meets minimum requirements. Future improvements would include being able to clear the events.
